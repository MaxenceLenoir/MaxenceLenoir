### Hi Mysterious Traveller ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Fullstack Freelance Developper who began his new carrer after a bootcamp at [LeWagon](https://github.com/lewagon).
After this bootcamp, I became Teacher Assistant and gave some classes. Beside that, I started to work on some Freelance projects.

My main stack is Ruby on Rails, but I like to discover new things that's why I've already completed several courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
Here some examples :
- Modern React with Redux
- Typescript : The Complete Developer's Guide
- Node with React
- Developpement Web Javascript : Node.Js & Mongo DB
- Flutter & Dart
- Docker and Kubernets : The Complete Guide
- ...

Recently, I made my first contribution to a public repository. I use my new skills in order to help the really nice [covilist](https://github.com/hostolab/covidliste) project.
